# Scrollstory

jQuery widget for stacked, scroll-based stories (or items) that need to give focus to a single item at a time.

Key features include:
- 100% style agnostic. Just a collection of scroll-based patterns I often use.
- Can can you existing DOM or use an array of objects to create markup.
- 16+ jQueryUI-style events/callbacks for various application state events.
- Focus and blur event when an individual story becomes active or inactive.
- Items can be grouped into categories, with event dispatched as categories change.
- Items filterable by user-specifed tags.
- Items aware of their in-viewport status.
- Programatic animated scroll to any item.
- Throttled scroll events and minimal DOM usage.
