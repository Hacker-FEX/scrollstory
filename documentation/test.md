# ScrollStory Test Example

A jQuery plugin for building scroll-based stories and interactions. Rather doing a specific task, it aims to be a tool to help solve general problems. 

For example, it can help you update your nav as you scroll done the page. It can auto-scroll to sections of your story on a mouse click. It can trigger custom callbacks that manipulate the page as you scroll, like lazy loading media. It can dynamically insert items into the page, or use pre-existing markup. Additionally, it maintains the data associated with all these custom interactions.
